## Music player for a Chromecast with a terminal UI.

Simple as this, no advanced features, runs in the terminal.

Per default, it searches through the Music folder in the home directory, or a custom directory, and then casts the songs to a chromecast device.

Spartan controls via keyboard to play next random song, pause current song, stop (redundant) or quit the program.

Features:
  * Track playing shown
  * Progress bar
  * Simple controls for playing random music


Requirements (can be installed with pip):
  *  mutagen [https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen]
  *  pychromecast [https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/pychromecast]
